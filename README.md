## Common Answer
### If assignment has 2 or more files
If the assignment has 2 or more files required, the individual file will be denoted as such:

```
File.name:
----------
// Code...
```

### If assignment has a prefix of `M-`
If an assignment has a prefix of `M-` it's an actual school project, not a CodeHS assignment and can be ignored.
